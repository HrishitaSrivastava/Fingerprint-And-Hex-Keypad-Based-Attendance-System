# Fingerprint & HexKeypad Based Attendance System

A secure, biometric attendance system that combines fingerprint recognition with a Hex keypad interface to prevent proxy attendance and ensure reliable identity verification. The system features a responsive web dashboard for real-time monitoring and role-based access.

## Project Overview

This project simulates a multi-factor authentication system for attendance tracking. It integrates biometric input and keypad verification with a cloud-connected frontend dashboard, enabling administrators to monitor attendance logs and user activity securely.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** ReactJS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Cloud Storage:** Firebase  
- **Embedded Logic:** Microcontroller scripts (Fingerprint sensor + Hex keypad)  
- **Dashboard Features:** Role-based access, dynamic rendering, responsive UI  

## Key Features

- **Biometric Verification:** Fingerprint sensor integration for secure identity capture  
- **Hex Keypad Input:** Secondary verification layer to prevent spoofing  
- **Real-Time Dashboard:** ReactJS-based interface to view attendance logs and user roles  
- **Cloud Sync:** Firebase used for asynchronous data storage and retrieval  
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for desktops and tablets with clean UI components

- ## Impact

- Prevents proxy attendance through dual-layer identity verification  
- Enables real-time monitoring and secure data logging  
- Demonstrates integration of embedded systems with modern frontend frameworks  

## Future Enhancements

- Add mobile app interface for administrators  
- Integrate SMS/email alerts for attendance anomalies  
- Expand biometric support (e.g., face recognition)  
- Implement analytics dashboard for attendance trends
